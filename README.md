I. Project Background Information
Repository Address: https://github.com/Limingxia890/journal
This project is a collection of applications meticulously developed based on the Streamlit framework. Streamlit, as a powerful open-source Python library, enables the rapid transformation of data science scripts into interactive web applications. This project leverages this advantage to create a feature-rich and user-friendly platform.

The project encompasses multiple key functional modules, including but not limited to the registration and management of technical documents, the classification, storage, and retrieval of electronic journals, as well as the configuration and interaction interfaces for Large Language Models (LLMs) and chatbots. Through these functionalities, users can conveniently record technical documents, manage electronic journal resources, and also configure and test chatbots to achieve intelligent interactive experiences.

The core purpose of the project is to provide a set of efficient tools for data recording, management, and interaction for related work. Whether researchers, engineers, or developers, users can find functionalities that meet their needs on this platform, thereby completing their work more efficiently. Through Streamlit's intuitive interface and powerful functionalities, this project significantly simplifies complex data processing workflows, improves work efficiency, and also offers users more customization options to adapt to different usage scenarios.
